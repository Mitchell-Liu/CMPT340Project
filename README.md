OCELOT -- Overlapped Cell On Tissue Data Histopathology

# Introduction ‚úèÔ∏è
Cell detection in histology images is one of the most important tasks in computational pathology. Recently, the OCELOT dataset is released in [dataset](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ryu_OCELOT_Overlapped_Cell_on_Tissue_Dataset_for_Histopathology_CVPR_2023_paper.html) which provides overlapping cell and tissue annotations on images acquired from multiple organs stained with H&E. [dataset](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ryu_OCELOT_Overlapped_Cell_on_Tissue_Dataset_for_Histopathology_CVPR_2023_paper.html) showed that understanding the relationship between the surrounding tissue structures and individual cells can boost cell detection performance.

With the newly released OCELOT dataset, our project is aim to promote research on how to utilize cell-tissue relationships for better cell detection. Unlike typical cell detection challenges, our project can utilize tissue patches and annotation for the purpose of boosting cell detection performance.

## 4. Guidance

- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
    - Do NOT use history re-editing (rebase)
    - Commit messages should be informative:
        - No: 'this should fix it', 'bump' commit messages
        - Yes: 'Resolve invalid API call in updating X'
    - Do NOT include IDE folders (.idea), or hidden files. Update your .gitignore where needed.
    - Do NOT use the repository to upload data
- Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a similarly powerful IDE
- Use [Copilot for free](https://dev.to/twizelissa/how-to-enable-github-copilot-for-free-as-student-4kal)
- Sign up for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)
